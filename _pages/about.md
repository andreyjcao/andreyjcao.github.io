Hello, my name is Andrey, but I usually go by Andy. I am currently studying environmental studies (with a policy focus) and sociology at Middlebury College. Outside of the classroom, I examine the effects of inequality through community engagement such as cooking at a local emergency shelter. I also curate and create graphics (and occasionally write) for my college's satire newspaper. My pursuit of research, problem-solving, and direct service drives my search for new opportunities. Both my passions and experiences inspire me to explore the intersections between policy, nonprofits, businesses, and the natural world. This portfolio showcases some of my work in my geography classes (specifically GEOG 0361: Open GIScience).
