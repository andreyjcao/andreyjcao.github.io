Throughout the reproduction of Malcomb et al. (2014), I focused on improving transparency with the addition of written analyses as well as more direct acknowledgements of inconsistencies within the original study. 
The discussion, conclusion, and rationale sections will help showcase the deviations, results, and reasoning behind this reproduction.
By directly addressing the inconsistent labels and equations on the original study’s figures, this reproduction will more thoroughly represent why we failed to get perfectly correlated figures. 

The process of writing the discussion, conclusion, and ‘rationale for the updated report’ sections helped me to rethink and analyze each deviation to the original study.
Going through each step of the study emphasized the need for transparency for both the original study and its reproduction.
Additionally, this study’s reproduction also emphasized the importance of construct validity as the figures did not represent what they were labeled to represent.
By clarifying the reasonings and inconsistencies of the Malcomb et al. (2014) study, the reproduction will improve the understanding behind the study’s vulnerability model for Malawi.
